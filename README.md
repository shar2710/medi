## Installation
To set up MediBot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MediBot.git
   cd MediBot
   ```
2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (for backend Python logic):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```
5. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
   - Add your Gemini API key:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
     ```

## Usage

### Backend
Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

### Frontend
Start the React frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Python Apps (Optional)
To run the Python-based chatbots (if using Panel):
```bash
panel serve src/basic.py
panel serve src/report_assisstant.py
panel serve src/advanced.py
```
Or all together:
```bash
panel serve src/advanced.py src/basic.py src/report_assisstant.py
```

#### Integrate Panel App in React
To show the Python Panel app inside your React frontend, add an iframe in your React component:

```jsx
<iframe
   src="http://localhost:5006/"
   title="MediBot Panel"
   style={{ width: '100%', height: '800px', border: 'none' }}
/>
```
Place this in any React component (e.g., `App.js`) to embed the Panel dashboard UI directly in your React app.
